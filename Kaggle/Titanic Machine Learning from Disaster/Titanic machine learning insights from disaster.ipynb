Those pink values in \"title_Master\" row means that the few people that had the title Master had increased chance to survive.\n\nSome insights we can get from this plot:\n* The model ignored the bottom 5 features.\n* Binary features only have 2 possible colors.\n* High values of \"Pclass\" caused lower predictions, and high values caused higher predictions."
