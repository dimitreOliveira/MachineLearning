More formally, a BN is defined as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and a set of Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs). In practice, a problem domain is initially modeled as a DAG.\n* Naive Bayes assumes that the variables are independent and comes from a Gaussian distribution.\n\n#### The Bayes theorem\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scienceprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thomas_Bayes.png?fit=468%2C308&ssl=1\" width=\"400\">\n* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of class (A, target) given predictor (B,  attributes).\n* P(A) is the prior probability of class.\n* P(B|A) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given class.\n* P(B) is the prior probability of predictor.\n\n### Now let's apply this knowledge by building a Naive Bayes model on this data set."

It would be handy if we have something to manage all this limited/conflicting information.\n* It is easy and fast to predict class of test data set. It also perform well in multi class prediction\n* When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.\n* It perform well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s). For numerical variable, normal distribution is assumed (bell curve, which is a strong assumption).\n\n#### Cons:\n* Probably the most notable weakness of BNs is the designing methodology.There is no standard way of building BNs.\n* If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use the smoothing technique. One of the simplest smoothing techniques is called Laplace estimation.\n* On the other side naive Bayes is also known as a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict_proba are not to be taken too seriously.\n* Another limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent.\n\n##### The design of a BN can be a considerable amount of effort in complex systems and it is based on the knowledge of the expert(s) who designed it. Although, this disadvantage can be good in another point of view, since BNs can be easily inspected by the designers and has the guarantee that the domain specific information is being used.\n\n### Tips to improve the power of Naive Bayes Model\n#### Here are some tips for improving power of Naive Bayes Model:\n\n* If continuous features do not have normal distribution, we should use transformation or different methods to convert it in normal distribution.\n* If test data set has zero frequency issue, apply smoothing techniques “Laplace Correction” to predict the class of test data set.\n* Remove correlated features, as the highly correlated features are voted twice in the model and it can lead to over inflating importance.\n* Naive Bayes classifiers has limited options for parameter tuning like alpha=1 for smoothing, fit_prior=[True|False] to learn class prior probabilities or not and some other options (look at detail here). I would recommend to focus on your  pre-processing of data and the feature selection.\n* You might think to apply some classifier combination technique like ensembling, bagging and boosting but these methods would not help. Actually, “ensembling, boosting, bagging” won’t help since their purpose is to reduce variance. Naive Bayes has no variance to minimize.\n\n\n### References\n* [Introduction to Bayesian Networks with Jhonatan de Souza Oliveira - Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-bayesian-networks-with-jhonatan-de-souza-oliveira/)\n* [6 Easy Steps to Learn Naive Bayes Algorithm (with codes in Python and R) - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/naive-bayes-explained/)\n* [Better Naive Bayes: 12 Tips To Get The Most From The Naive Bayes Algorithm - Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/better-naive-bayes/)"
