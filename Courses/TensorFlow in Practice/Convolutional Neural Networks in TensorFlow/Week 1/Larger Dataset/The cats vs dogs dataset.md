In the next video, you'll look at the famous Kaggle Dogs v Cats dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

This was originally a challenge in building a classifier aimed at the world's best Machine Learning and AI Practitioners, but the technology has advanced so quickly, you'll see how you can do it in just a few minutes with some simple Convolutional Neural Network programming.

It's also a nice exercise in looking at a larger dataset, downloading and preparing it for training, as well as handling some preprocessing of data. Even data like this which has been carefully curated for you can have errors -- as you'll notice with some corrupt images!

Also, you may notice some warnings about missing or corrupt EXIF data as the images are being loaded into the model for training. Don't worry about this -- it won't impact your model! :)
