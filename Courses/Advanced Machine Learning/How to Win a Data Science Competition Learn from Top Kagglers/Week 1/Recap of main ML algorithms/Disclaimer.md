The following quizzes are aimed to check your knowledge of basic ML algorithms. Not all the information was covered in video lectures and we expect that you, as pointed in prerequisites, remember what is RF, GBDT, kNN.

If you don't know these abbreviations — you can check your Glossary (under Supplementary Materials tab).

You may find helpful these links while solving the quizz:
