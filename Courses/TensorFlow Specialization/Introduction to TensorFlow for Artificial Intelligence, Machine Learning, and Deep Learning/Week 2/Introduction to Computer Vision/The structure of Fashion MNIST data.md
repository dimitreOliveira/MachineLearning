Here you saw how the data can be loaded into Python data structures that make it easy to train a neural network. You saw how the image is represented as a 28x28 array of greyscales, and how its label is a number. Using a number is a first step in avoiding bias -- instead of labelling it with words in a specific language and excluding people who don’t speak that language! You can learn more about bias and techniques to avoid it [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/fairness-overview/).
